Default shutdown wattage is around 1 to 1.4W. However this can be decreased by manually editing the EEPROM
configuration, 

sudo rpi-eeprom-config -e and change the settings to:



# Enable UART output during the boot process for debugging or information
BOOT_UART=1

# Power off the Raspberry Pi completely when halted (shutdown)
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1

# Define the boot order bit pattern
# Bit 0: USB mass storage device
# Bit 1: SD card
# Bit 2: Network boot (PXE)
# Bit 3: Boot from USB device
BOOT_ORDER=0xf416  # Binary: 1111 0100 0001 0110
# This means the Raspberry Pi will attempt to boot in the order of:
# 1. USB mass storage device
# 2. SD card
# 3. Network boot (PXE)
# 4. Boot from USB device
